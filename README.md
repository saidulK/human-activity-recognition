# Human Activity Recognition with smartphone sensors
In this project, A system was developed to collect smartphone IMU data in realtime and predict peformed activities from it.

## Description
The system was built using python and consists of 3 major parts:

1. Sensor data streaming
2. Data processing and prediction
3. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

### Sensor data streaming and processing 
Sensor data from smartphone was streamed in realtime using a custom made android application. The app used bluetooth to establish connection and transfer data to the PC. 
A python program was written using the pybluez library that maintained connection with the app and stored data in a buffer. The data was processed and fed to the deep-learning 
model to predict performed activity. 

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was built using python library PyQt5 for the sytem.
